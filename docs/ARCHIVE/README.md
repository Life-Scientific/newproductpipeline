This directory contains old documentation that's no longer actively used but kept for reference.

## Structure

- **`old-merge-strategies/`** - Previous Git branching strategies (person-based branches, complex merge plans)
- **`NEXT_STEPS.md`** - Old planning documents
- **`UI_BUSINESS_CASES_FIX.md`** - Completed fixes

## Current Workflow

We now use a simpler workflow: **one branch per feature, delete after merge**.

See [`../workflow/GIT_WORKFLOW.md`](../workflow/GIT_WORKFLOW.md) for current practices.
